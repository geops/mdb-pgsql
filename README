This script converts Microsoft Access 2000 MDB databases to postgresql SQL files
without needing an installation of Microsoft Access itself.

The hard work is done by the excellent mdb-sqlite.
This script just uses the sqlite database to generate to posgresql insert from it

Accordingly you need to install and build mdb-sqlite. The program can be downloaded
at https://github.com/tinogomes/mdb-sqlite
See the build instructions there to build the JAR file.

Usage
-----

Before using mdb-ppgsql the environment variable MDB_SQLITE_JAR with the
path to the mdb-sqlite jar has to be set. Example:
  export MDB_SQLITE_JAR=/home/myself/jars/mdb-sqlite.jar

After that the script can be used like

  mdb-pgsql.sh <mdb file> [<target schema>]

The <target schema> parameter is optional. If not set, the schema
"pubilc" will be used.

The generated SQL will be written to the standard output. It is recommended
to pipe it to a file.


This script depends on
----------------------

- Java
- The mdb-sqlite Jar
- sqlite3 command line tool
- various Unix tools like sed, tr, cat and grep
